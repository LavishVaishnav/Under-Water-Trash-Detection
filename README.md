# Under-Water-Trash-Detection

Overview
This project aims to develop a system for underwater trash detection using computer vision techniques. The system utilizes image processing algorithms to identify and classify different types of waste submerged underwater. By detecting and categorizing underwater trash, we aim to contribute to environmental conservation efforts and promote cleaner oceans.
