# Under-Water-Trash-Detection

**Overview:**

This project focuses on developing an advanced system for detecting underwater trash using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. By leveraging image processing algorithms, the system identifies and classifies various types of submerged waste. The goal is to contribute to environmental conservation by promoting cleaner oceans through efficient trash detection and categorization.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled underwater images, identifying different categories of trash. It can be sourced from [source link] and must be organized as outlined in the `data/` directory to ensure smooth integration with the model.

**Model Architecture:**

The model is built on the YOLOv8 architecture, optimized for real-time detection and classification of underwater trash. Detailed model configurations and architecture specifications can be found in the `model/` directory.

**Training:**

The training process uses the labeled dataset to fine-tune the model, reducing classification errors. Scripts and detailed training guidelines are available in the `train/` directory.

**Evaluation:**

The model’s performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluation scripts and instructions can be found in the `evaluate/` directory.

**Usage:**

After successful training and evaluation, the model is ready for real-world underwater trash detection. Comprehensive usage instructions and example implementations are provided in the `usage/` directory.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to enhance the project! If you have ideas for improvements, feature requests, or bug reports, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
